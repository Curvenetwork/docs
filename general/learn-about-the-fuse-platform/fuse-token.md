# Curve Token (CURVE)

The CURVE token is the native currency of the Curve blockchain and platform, just like ETH on Ethereum.

## CURVE utility:

* **Transaction fees** Being the native currency on the Curve blockchain, CURVE is required to pay fees to the network in order to approve transactions.
* **Validation** Token holders can stake Curve to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 100K. The network is growing, currently there are 60 validators. ([https://status.curvescan.io/](https://status.curvescan.io/))
* **Voting** Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked CURVE. Which means validators with higher amounts of Curve staked can have a bigger vote on network upgrades and governance changes (until phase 2 where delegation is activated)
* **Staking (for delegators)** Any CURVE holder can choose one or more validators to delegate any amount of CURVE they wish. They receive a share of the Curve block rewards proportionate to the share of their stake in the total stake, minus the minimum 15% fee paid to the validator(s).
* **Payments** As CURVE is the native currency on Curve, sending it does not require interactions with smart contracts. Thus, CURVE transfers are potentially faster and less costly in terms of transaction fees.

**IMPORTANT**: Merely possessing any amount of CURVE tokens does not endow holders with any rights to participate in the governance of the Curve platform or any revenue streams related to its real-world performance.
